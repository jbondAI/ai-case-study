## Image Recognition Market Landscape

**Market Overview**

A growing demand for automation, as companies strive to enhance efficiency and productivity, has become a crucial strategy in overall market competitiveness, and frenzied race to find ways to leverage AI have emerged as major drivers for the image recognition products and services market. According to a June 2023 report issued by Allied Market Research, the global image recognition market was valued at $28.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow by 5x by 2032.[8]

Advancing image recognition capabilities in the healthcare sector is allowing healthcare providers to analyze medical images (i.e., X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans) with unprecedented precision and enabling increasingly efficient medical diagnosis and treatment. However, data availability hampers the growth of the market, this is because of privacy concerns, legal regulations, and proprietary limitations. Some image data may be protected by privacy laws, making it difficult to access or use for training purposes. Hence, intellectual property rights or proprietary restrictions may prevent the sharing or utilization of certain data sets, limiting the availability of valuable resources for training image recognition systems. Moreover, the concerns about the security of image databases and the risk of data breaches have further hampered image recognition market growth. On the contrary, technological advancements in cloud computing have revolutionized the market, providing opportunities for businesses to leverage the power of the cloud for processing, analyzing, and understanding visual data.

**Market Competitors**

Viso.ai operates within the AI image recognition domain alongside notable players in the image recognition field, including DeepVisionAI, ImageSense and VisionTech Solutions. Whereas platform companies like DeepVisionAI focus on providing advanced deep learning models that excel in complex image recognition tasks, other companies, offer specialized, sector-specific high-precision image analysis services, as with ImageSense for medical imaging applications. VisionTech Solutions has targeted its innovative solutions offerings to customers needing real-time object detection and tracking.
